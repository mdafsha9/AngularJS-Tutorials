    <h1>AngularJS</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a script tag.<br>
    AngularJS extends HTML attributes with ng-directives and binds data to HTML with expressions or ng-bind directive.</p>
    <h2>AngularJS directives</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>ng-app directive</dt>
      <dd>ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.<br>
       ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap(automatically initializes) the application when a web page is loaded.</dd>
      <dt>ng-model directive</dt>
      <dd>ng-model directive binds the values of HTML controls(input, textarea, select) to application data.<br>
      ng-model directive can also:
      <ul>
        <li>provide type validation to application data(number, email, required)</li>
        <li>provide status for application data(invalid, dirty, touched, error)</li>
        <li>provide css classes for HTML elements</li>
        <li>provide HTML elements to HTML forms</li>
      </ul></dd>
      <dt>ng-bind directive</dt>
      <dd>ng-bind directive binds application data to HTML view</dd>
      <dt>ng-init directive</dt>
      <dd>ng-init directive initializes angularjs application variables</dd>
      <dt>ng-controller directives</dt>
      <dd>ng-controller directive defines the application controller</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>AngularJS Module</h2>
    <p>An AngularJS module defines an application.A module is a container for different parts of an application <br>
    and a module is a container for application controllers. Controllers always belongs to a module.</p>
    <h3>creating a module</h3>
    <p>A module is created by using angular.module</p>
    <h2>AngularJS Controllers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AngularJS controller controls the data of AngularJS application.</li>
      <li>AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript objects.</li>
      <li>AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers.</li>
      <li>ng-controller directive defines the application controller.</li>
      <li>A controller is a JavaScript object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>AngularJS Data Binding</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data binding in AngularJS is synchronization between the model and the view.</li>
      <li>AngularJS application usually have a data model. A data model is a collection of data available for the application</li>
      <li>The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed is called a view.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>AngularJS Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope is the binding part between the HTML(view) and JavaScript(Controller).<br>
    The scope is an object with the availabe properties and methods.<br>
    The scope is available for both the view and controllers.</p>
    <h3>How to use the scope ?</h3>
    <p>When we make a controller in AngualrJS, we pass the $scope object as an argument.<br>
      When adding properties to $scope object in the controller, the HTML(view) gets access to these properties.<br>
      If we make changes in the view, the model and controller will be updated.</p>
    <h3>Understanding the scope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>View, which is the HTML</li>
      <li>Model, which is the data available for the current view</li>
      <li>Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>AngularJS rootScope</h2>
    <p>All applications have $rootScope which is a scope created in an HTML element that contains ng-app directive.<br>
    The $rootScope is available in the entire application.<br>
    If a variable has the same name in the current scope and $rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope. </p>
