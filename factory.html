    <h2>AngularJS Factory</h2>
    <p>The factory services are used to communcate server wth the help of HTTP and also used to create reusable code for angularjs applicaton.
      The factories in angularjs wll also return a new instance for each object but it will not happen in services n angularjs</p>
      <p>The major difference between services and factory i.e., we can run custom code in the factory. But n the services we can use only object creations     </p>
