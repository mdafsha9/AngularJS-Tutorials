    <h1>AngularJS</h1>
    <h3>What is  AngularJS?</h3>
    <p>AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to HTML with script tags.AngularJS extends HTML attributes with directives and it binds data to HTML with expression or ng-bind directive.<br>
    It runs on plain JavaScript and HTML, so we dont need any other dependencies to make it work. AngularJS is perfect for SPA.It is basically used to bind JavaSCript objects with HTML UI elements.</p>
    <h3>architecture of AngularJS</h3>
    <p>AngularJS is architecture on 3 components.They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the template(view), which is the HTML</li>
      <li>the scope(model), which is the data available for the current view</li>
      <li>the controller(controller), which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How do you share data between controllers in AngularJS ?</h3>
    <p>We can share data by creating a service. Services are easiest, fastest and cleaner way to share data between controllers in AngularJS.<br>
    There are also ways to share data between controllers, they are<br>
    1.Using Events,<br>
    2.$parent, nextSibling, controllerAs,
    3.Using the $rootScope<br></p>
    <h3>AngularJS Difgest cycle</h3>
    <p>AngularJS digest cycle is the process behind AngularJS data binding. In each digest cycle, Angular compares old and new versions of scope model values. The digest cycle is triggered automatically. we can also use $apply(), if we want totrigger the digest cycle manually.</p>
    <h3>differnce between AngularJS and JavaSCript expressions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Both can contain literals, operators and variables</li>
      <li>AngularJS expressions can be written in HTML but JavaScript expressions are not.</li>
      <li>AngularJS expressions do not support condiitonals, loops and exceptions but JavaScript expressions can do.</li>
      <li>AngularJS expressions support filter but JavaScript expressions do not</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Basic steps to setup an AngularJS application</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an angular.module</li>
      <li>assin a controller to module</li>
      <li>link a module to HTML ng-app directive</li>
      <li>then link a controller to HTML ng-controller directive</li>
    </ul
