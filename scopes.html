    <h1>AngularJS</h1>
    <h2>AngularJS Scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The scope is the binding part between the HTML(view) and the JavaScript(controller)</li>
      <li>The scope is an object with the available properties and methods</li>
      <li>The scope is availbale for both view and controller</li>
      <li>When we make a controller in angularjs application, we pass a $scope object as an argument</li>
      <li>when adding properties to $scope object in the controller, view(HTML) gets access to these properties
    </ul>
    <h3>Understanding the scope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Angularjs application consists of</li>
      <li>the template(view), which is the HTML</li>
      <li>the scope(model), which is the data available in the current view</li>
      <li>the controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/control the data</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Then the scope is model.<br>
      The scope is a Javascript object with the properties and methods, which are available for both view and controller</p>
    <h2>rootScope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All applications have $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains ng-app directive</li>
      <li>The $rootScope is available in the entire application</li>
      <li>if a variable has the same name for the current scope and $rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>scope hierarchy</h2>
    <p>Every application developed in AngularJS has one $rootScope object and many child $scope objects. when a new scope is created that is added to the parent scope. This results the creation of hierarhy structure like DOM structure.</p>
    <div ng-app="mySc">
      <h3>rootscope color is</h3>
        {{color}}
      <div ng-controller="myCtrlSc">
        <h3>controller scope color is</h3>
        {{color}}
      </div>
      <h3>rootscope color is</h3>
        {{color}}
    </div>
    <script src="myApp.js"></script>
    <script src="myCtrl.js"></script>
